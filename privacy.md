Very many websites, including this one, send you cookies when you visit the site in order to collect data to track traffic flows.  A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or other device browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive.  Whether or not you receive a cookie depends on your browser settings.  Cookies record information about the location of your IP provider, technical data about your computer and data about which pages you look at on this website and how these were accessed.

If you have a website or blog yourself then you are probably collecting statistical data relating to traffic flows in a very similar way.
