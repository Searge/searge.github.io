## Systems Engineer from Ukraine

My focus is on creating and supporting robust IT infrastructures.
I'm especially passionate about Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Ansible and Terraform, automating tasks using Bash and Python, and building custom tools in Go for Kubernetes.

Outside of tech, I used to be into art, photography, and working with granite. I also love exploring languages, both the human kind and programming.
